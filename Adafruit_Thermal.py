# This is a Python library for the Adafruit Thermal Printer.
# Pick one up at --> http://www.adafruit.com/products/597
# These printers use TTL serial to communicate, 2 pins are required.
# IMPORTANT: On 3.3V systems (e.g. Raspberry Pi), use a 10K resistor on
# the RX pin (TX on the printer, green wire), or simply leave unconnected.

# This is pretty much a 1:1 direct Python port of the Adafruit_Thermal
# library for Arduino.  All methods use the same naming conventions as the
# Arduino library, with only slight changes in parameter behavior where
# needed.  This should simplify porting existing Adafruit_Thermal-based
# printer projects to Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone, etc.  See printertest.py
# for an example.
#
# One significant change is the addition of the printImage() function,
# which ties this to the Python Imaging Library and opens the door to a
# lot of cool graphical stuff!
#
# TO DO:
# - Might use standard ConfigParser library to put thermal calibration
#   settings in a global configuration file (rather than in the library).
# - Make this use proper Python library installation procedure.
# - Trap errors properly.  Some stuff just falls through right now.
# - Add docstrings throughout!

# Python 2.X code using the library usu. needs to include the next line:

	# Because there's no flow control between the printer and computer,

	# an operation is issued to the printer (e.g. bitmap print), a
	# timeout is set before which any other printer operations will be
	# suspended.  This is generally more efficient than using a delay
	# in that it allows the calling code to continue with other duties

	# time.  The default print and feed times are based on a random
